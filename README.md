## About RelaxedTruckers
Relaxed Truckers Logistics is a fun and friendly VTC for all to join.
We have an active Staff Team, Host monthly convoys for everyone to come along to but most of all, we take a "relaxed" approach to a community. 
We have no job or active requirements, we prioritise IRL Commitments. Which makes RTL the best place to be.

We also have a subsidiary, Relaxed Gaming. Over there we support practically any game and have weekly events for all our members to join.
We even have our own game servers, such as Farming Sim and Minecraft, of which is soon to expand!
